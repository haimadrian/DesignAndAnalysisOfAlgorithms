# Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Repository to demonstrate algorithms that learnt during DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms course, HIT, year B, 2nd semester.  
Useful for Exam preparation

## How to open this project in Intellij
* Clone the repository
* File->Open
* Navigate to DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms\Code\Algo and select build.gradle, then open it As Project
* On the project window (left side of Intellij) right click Algo and then "Open Module Settings" (F4)
* Select a project SDK according to a JDK that you have on your machine. (java 1.8 / java 11, etc.)
* Main class is: AlgoMain
* There is already a launcher I created. 
* At the main menu: Run -> Edit Configurations: expand "Application" and select "AlgoMain"
* Configure a JRE to use, again depends on the JRE you have on your machine, and then "Apply" or "OK"
* Now you have "AlgoMain" launcher. Run it and crack the exam.
